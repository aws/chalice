    # On windows the C compiling story is much more complex than on posix as
    # there are many different C compilers that setuptools and disutils will
    # try and find using a combination of known filepaths, registry entries,
    # and environment variables. Since there is no simple environment variable
    # we can replace when starting the subprocess that builds the package;
    # we need to apply a patch at runtime to prevent pip/setuptools/distutils
    # from being able to build C extensions.
    # Patching out every possible technique for finding each compiler would
    # be a losing game of whack-a-mole. In addition we need to apply a patch
    # two layers down through subprocess calls, specifically:
    #  * Chalice creates a subprocess of `pip wheel ...` to build sdists
    #    into wheel files.
    #  * Pip creates another python subprocess to call the setup.py file in
    #    the sdist. Before doing so it applies the above shim to make the
    #    setup file compatible with setuptools. This shim layer also reads
    #    and executes the code in the setup.py.
    #  * Setuptools (which will have been executed by the shim) will
    #    eventually call distutils to do the heavy lifting for C compiling.
    #
    # Our patch needs to affect the bottom level here (distutils) and patch
    # it out to prevent it from compiling C in a graceful way that results in
    # falling back to building a purepython library if possible.
    # The below line will be injected just before the `pip wheel ...` portion
    # of the subprocess that Chalice starts. This replaces the
    # SETUPTOOLS_SHIM that pip normally uses with the one defined above.
    # When pip goes to run its subprocess for executing setup.py it will
    # inject _SETUPTOOLS_SHIM rather than the usual SETUPTOOLS_SHIM in pip.
    # This lets us apply our patches in the same process that will compile
    # the c extensions before the setup.py file has been executed.
