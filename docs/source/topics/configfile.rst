Configuration File
==================

Whenever you create a new project using
``chalice new-project``, a ``.chalice`` directory is created
for you.  In this directory is a ``config.json`` file that
you can use to control what happens when you ``chalice deploy``::


    $ tree -a
    .
    ├── .chalice
    │   └── config.json
    ├── app.py
    └── requirements.txt

    1 directory, 3 files


.. _stage-config:

Stage Specific Configuration
----------------------------

As of version 0.7.0 of chalice, you can specify configuration
that is specific to a chalice stage as well as configuration that should
be shared across all stages.  See the :doc:`stages` doc for more
information about chalice stages.

* ``stages`` - This value of this key is a mapping of chalice stage
  name to stage configuration.  Chalice assumes a default stage name
  of ``dev``.  If you run the ``chalice new-project`` command on
  chalice 0.7.0 or higher, this key along with the default ``dev``
  key will automatically be created for you.  See the examples
  section below for some stage specific configurations.

The following config values can either be specified per stage config
or as a top level key which is not tied to a specific stage.  Whenever
a stage specific configuration value is needed, the ``stages`` mapping
is checked first.  If no value is found then the top level keys will
be checked.


``api_gateway_endpoint_type``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The endpoint configuration of the deployed API Gateway which determines how the
API will be accessed, can be EDGE, REGIONAL, PRIVATE. Note this value can only
be set as a top level key and defaults to EDGE. For more information see
https://amzn.to/2LofApt


``api_gateway_endpoint_vpce``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When configuring a Private API a VPC Endpoint id must be specified to configure
a default resource policy on the API if an explicit policy is not specified.
This value can be a list or a string of endpoint ids.


``api_gateway_policy_file``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A file pointing to an IAM resource policy for the REST API. If not specified
chalice will autogenerate this policy when endpoint_type is PRIVATE. This
filename is relative to the ``.chalice`` directory.


``api_gateway_stage``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the API gateway stage.  This will also be the URL prefix for your
API (``https://endpoint/prefix/your-api``).


``autogen_policy``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean value that indicates if chalice should try to automatically generate
an IAM policy based on analyzing your application source code.  The default
value is ``true``.  If this value is ``false`` then chalice will try to load an
IAM policy from disk at ``.chalice/policy-<stage-name>.json`` instead of
auto-generating a policy from source code analysis. You can change the filename
by providing the ``iam_policy_file`` config option.
See :ref:`iam-role-pol-examples` for examples of how to configure IAM roles
and policies.


``environment_variables``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mapping of key value pairs.  These key value pairs will be set as environment
variables in your application.  All environment variables must be strings.  If
this key is specified in both a stage specific config option as well as a top
level key, the stage specific environment variables will be merged into the top
level keys.  See the :ref:`env-var-examples` section below for a concrete
example.


``iam_policy_file``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``autogen_policy`` is ``false``, Chalice will try to load an IAM policy
from disk instead of auto-generating one based on source code analysis.  The
default location of this file is ``.chalice/policy-<stage-name>.json``, e.g
``.chalice/policy-dev.json``, ``.chalice/policy-prod.json``, etc.  You can
change the filename by providing this ``iam_policy_file`` config option.  This
filename is relative to the ``.chalice`` directory.  For example, this config
will create an IAM role using the file in ``.chalice/my-policy.json``::

  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
        "autogen_policy": false,
        "iam_policy_file": "my-policy.json"
      }
    }
  }


See :ref:`iam-role-pol-examples` for more examples of how to configure IAM
roles and policies.


``iam_role_arn``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``manage_iam_role`` is ``false``, you must specify this value that indicates
which IAM role arn to use when configuration your application.  This value is
only used if ``manage_iam_role`` is ``false``.
See :ref:`iam-role-pol-examples` for examples of how to configure IAM roles
and policies.


``lambda_memory_size``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An integer representing the amount of memory, in MB, your Lambda function is
given. AWS Lambda uses this memory size to infer the amount of CPU allocated to
your function. The default ``lambda_memory_size`` value is ``128``. The value
must be a multiple of 64 MB.


``lambda_timeout``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An integer representing the function execution time, in seconds, at which AWS
Lambda should terminate the function. The default ``lambda_timeout`` is ``60``
seconds.


``layers``
~~~~~~~~~~

A list of Lambda Layers arns. This value can be provided per stage as well as
per Lambda function. See `AWS Lambda Layers Configuration`_.



.. _automatic-layer-option:

``automatic_layer``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean value that indicates whether chalice will automatically construct a
single stage layer for all Lambda functions with requirements.txt libraries and
vendored libraries.  Boolean value defaults to ``false`` if not specified.  See
:ref:`package-3rd-party` for more information.


.. _custom-domain-config-options:

``api_gateway_custom_domain``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mapping of key value pairs. The following are required keys when
specifying an ``api_gateway_custom_domain``:

- ``domain_name``: The custom domain name to associated with the REST API
  (api.example.com)
- ``certificate_arn``: the ARN of ACM certificate for the current domain name.
  If you're using a ``REGIONAL`` endpoint type for your API, the ACM
  certificate **must** be in the same region as your API.  If you're using an
  ``EDGE`` endpoint type, the certificate must be in ``us-east-1``.

You can also provide the following optional configuration:

- ``tls_version`` - The Transport Layer Security (TLS) version of the security
  policy for this domain name.  Defaults to ``TLS_1_2``, you can also provide
  ``TLS_1_0`` for REST APIs.
- ``url_prefix`` - A custom domain name plus a url_prefix (BasePathMapping)
  specification identifies a deployed REST API in a given stage. With custom
  domain names, you can set up your API's hostname, and choose a base path (for
  example, `myservice`) to map the alternative URL to your API (for example
  ``https://api.example.com/myservice``).  If you don't set any ``url_prefix``,
  the resulting API's base URL is the same as the custom domain (for example
  ``https://api.example.com/``).
- tags - A dictionary of tags with the keys being the tag key, and the values
  being the value for the tag.

See the :doc:`domainname` documentation for more information on configuring
your Chalice application with a custom domain name.

See `AWS Custom Domain names setup`_ for the API Gateway documentation on
configuring a custom domain name.

.. _custom-domain-ws-config-options:

``websocket_api_custom_domain``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mapping of key value pairs. The following are required keys when
specifying a ``websocket_api_custom_domain``:

- ``domain_name``: The custom domain name to associated with the REST API
  (api.example.com)
- ``certificate_arn``: the ARN of ACM certificate for the current domain name.
  If you're using a ``REGIONAL`` endpoint type for your API, the ACM
  certificate **must** be in the same region as your API.  If you're using an
  ``EDGE`` endpoint type, the certificate must be in ``us-east-1``.

You can also provide the following optional configuration:

- ``tls_version`` - The Transport Layer Security (TLS) version of the security
  policy for this domain name.  Defaults to ``TLS_1_2``, you can also provide
  ``TLS_1_0`` for REST APIs.
- ``url_prefix`` - A custom domain name plus a url_prefix (BasePathMapping)
  specification identifies a deployed REST API in a given stage. With custom
  domain names, you can set up your API's hostname, and choose a base path (for
  example, `myservice`) to map the alternative URL to your API (for example
  ``https://api.example.com/myservice``).  If you don't set any ``url_prefix``,
  the resulting API's base URL is the same as the custom domain (for example
  ``https://api.example.com/``).
- tags - A dictionary of tags with the keys being the tag key, and the values
  being the value for the tag.

See the :doc:`domainname` documentation for more information on configuring
your Chalice application with a custom domain name.

See `AWS Custom Domain names setup`_ for the API Gateway documentation on
configuring a custom domain name.

``manage_iam_role``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``true``/``false``.  Indicates if you want chalice to create and update the IAM
role used for your application.  By default, this value is ``true``.  However,
if you have a pre-existing role you've created, you can set this value to
``false`` and a role will not be created or updated.  ``"manage_iam_role":
false`` means that you are responsible for managing the role and any associated
policies associated with that role.  If this value is ``false`` you must
specify an ``iam_role_arn``, otherwise an error is raised when you try to run
``chalice deploy``.


``minimum_compression_size``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An integer value that indicates the minimum compression size to apply to the
API gateway. If this key is specified in both a stage specific config option as
well as a top level key, the stage specific key will override the top level key
for the given stage. For more information check out the `Service Docs
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-gzip-compression-decompression.html>`__


``reserved_concurrency``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An integer representing each function's reserved concurrency.  This value can
be provided per stage as well as per Lambda function. AWS Lambda reserves this
value of concurrency to each lambda deployed in this stage. If the value is set
to 0, invocations to this function are blocked. If the value is unset, there
will be no reserved concurrency allocations. For more information, see `AWS
Documentation on managing concurrency`_.


``subnet_ids``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of subnet ids for VPC configuration.  This value can be provided per
stage as well as per Lambda function.  In order for this value to take effect,
you must also provide the ``security_group_ids`` value.  When both values are
provided and ``autogen_policy`` is True, chalice will automatically update your
IAM role with the necessary permissions to create, describe, and delete ENIs.
If you are managing the IAM role policy yourself, make sure to update your
permissions accordingly, as described in the `AWS Lambda VPC documentation`_.


``security_group_ids``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of security groups for VPC configuration.  This value can be provided
per stage as well as per Lambda function.  In order for this value to take
effect, you must also provide the ``subnet_ids`` value.


``tags``
~~~~~~~~

A mapping of key value pairs. These key value pairs will be set as the tags on
the resources running your deployed application. All tag keys and values must
be strings. Similar to ``environment_variables``, if a key is specified in both
a stage specific config option as well as a top level key, the stage specific
tags will be merged into the top level keys. By default, all chalice deployed
resources are tagged with the key ``'aws-chalice'`` whose value is
``'version={chalice-version}:stage={stage-name}:app={app-name}'``.  Currently
only the following chalice deployed resources are tagged: Lambda functions.

``xray``
~~~~~~~~

A boolean that turns on AWS XRay's Active tracing configuration.
This will turn on XRay for both Lambda functions and API Gateway stages.

.. _lambda-config:

Lambda Specific Configuration
-----------------------------

In addition to a chalice stage, there are also some configuration values
that can be specified per Lambda function.  A chalice app can have many
stages, and a stage can have many Lambda functions.

You have the option to specify configuration for a lambda function across
all your stages, or for a lambda function in a specific stage.

To configure per lambda configuration for a specific stage, you add a
``lambda_functions`` key in your stage configuration::

  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
        "lambda_functions": {
          "foo": {
            "lambda_timeout": 120
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

To specify per lambda configuration across all stages, you add
a top level ``lambda_functions`` key::

  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "lambda_functions": {
      "foo": {
        "lambda_timeout": 120
      }
    }
  }


Each key in the ``lambda_functions`` dictionary is the name of a Lambda
function in your app.  The value is a dictionary of configuration that
will be applied to that function.  These are the configuration options
that can be applied per function:

* ``autogen_policy``
* ``environment_variables``
* ``iam_policy_file``
* ``iam_role_arn``
* ``lambda_memory_size``
* ``lambda_timeout``
* ``layers``
* ``manage_iam_role``
* ``reserved_concurrency``
* ``security_group_ids``
* ``subnet_ids``
* ``tags``


See the :ref:`stage-config` section above for a description
of these config options.

In general, the name of your lambda function will correspond to
the name of the function in your app.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @app.lambda_function()
    def foo(event, context):
        pass

To specify configuration for this function, you would use the
key of ``foo`` in the ``lambda_functions`` configuration.

There is one exception to this, which is any python function
decorated with the ``@app.route()`` decorator.  Chalice uses
a single Lambda function for all requests from API gateway,
and this name is ``api_handler``.  So if you have an app
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    @app.route('/')
    def index(): pass

    @app.route('/foo/bar')
    def other_handler(): pass

Then to specify configuration values for the underlying
lambda function, which ``index()`` and ``other_handler()`` share,
you would specify:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "lambda_functions": {
        "api_handler": {
          "subnet_ids": ["sn-1", "sn-2"],
          "security_group_ids": ["sg-10", "sg-11"],
          "layers": ["layer-arn-1", "layer-arn-2"],
        }
      }
    }


Examples
--------

Below are examples that show how you can configure your chalice app.

Custom Domain Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example for configuring Custom domain name for
dev stage for REST API::

  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
        "autogen_policy": true,
        "api_gateway_stage": "dev"
        "api_gateway_custom_domain": {
          "domain_name": "api.example.com",
          "security_policy": "TLS 1.2|TLS 1.0",
          "certificate_arn": "arn:aws:acm:example.com",
          "url_prefixes": ["foo", "bar"],
          "tags": {
            "key": "tag1",
            "key1": "tag2"
          }
        },
      },
    }
  }

In this config file we're specifying ``dev`` stage for ApiGateway.
In the ``dev`` stage, chalice will automatically create ``custom domain name``
with specified ``url_prefixes`` that should contain information about
`AWS Api Mapping key`_.

If there is Websocket API ``websocket_api_custom_domain`` should be used
instead of ``api_gateway_custom_domain``.

.. _iam-role-pol-examples:

IAM Roles and Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Here's an example for configuring IAM policies across stages::

  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
        "autogen_policy": true,
        "api_gateway_stage": "dev"
      },
      "beta": {
        "autogen_policy": false,
        "iam_policy_file": "beta-app-policy.json"
      },
      "prod": {
        "manage_iam_role": false,
        "iam_role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::...:role/prod-role"
      }
    }
  }

In this config file we're specifying three stages, ``dev``, ``beta``,
and ``prod``.  In the ``dev`` stage, chalice will automatically
generate an IAM policy based on analyzing the application source code.
For the ``beta`` stage, chalice will load the
``.chalice/beta-app-policy.json`` file and use it as the policy to
associate with the IAM role for that stage.  In the ``prod`` stage,
chalice won't modify any IAM roles.  It will just set the IAM role
for the Lambda function to be ``arn:aws:iam::...:role/prod-role``.

Here's an example that shows config precedence::


  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "api_gateway_stage": "api",
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
      },
      "beta": {
      },
      "prod": {
        "api_gateway_stage": "prod",
        "manage_iam_role": false,
        "iam_role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::...:role/prod-role"
      }
    }
  }

In this config file, both the ``dev`` and ``beta`` stage will
have an API gateway stage name of ``api`` because they will
default to the top level ``api_gateway_stage`` key.
However, the ``prod`` stage will have an API gateway stage
name of ``prod`` because the ``api_gateway_stage`` is specified
in ``{"stages": {"prod": ...}}`` mapping.



.. _env-var-examples:

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


In the following example, environment variables are specified
both as top level keys as well as per stage.  This allows us to
provide environment variables that all stages should have as well
as stage specific environment variables::


  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "app",
    "environment_variables": {
      "SHARED_CONFIG": "foo",
      "OTHER_CONFIG": "from-top"
    },
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
        "environment_variables": {
          "TABLE_NAME": "dev-table",
          "OTHER_CONFIG": "dev-value"
        }
      },
      "prod": {
        "environment_variables": {
          "TABLE_NAME": "prod-table",
          "OTHER_CONFIG": "prod-value"
        }
      }
    }
  }

For the above config, the ``dev`` stage will have the
following environment variables set::

  {
    "SHARED_CONFIG": "foo",
    "TABLE_NAME": "dev-table",
    "OTHER_CONFIG": "dev-value",
  }

The ``prod`` stage will have these environment variables set::

  {
    "SHARED_CONFIG": "foo",
    "TABLE_NAME": "prod-table",
    "OTHER_CONFIG": "prod-value",
  }


Per Lambda Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we had the following chalice app:

.. code-block:: python

    from chalice import Chalice

    app = Chalice(app_name='demo')

    @app.lambda_function()
    def foo(event, context):
        pass

    @app.lambda_function()
    def bar(event, context):
        pass


Given these two functions, we'd like to configure the functions
as follows:

* Both functions should have an environment variable ``OWNER`` with value
  ``dev-team``.
* The ``foo`` function should have an autogenerated IAM policy managed by
  chalice.
* The ``foo`` function should be run in a VPC with subnet ids ``sn-1`` and
  ``sn-2``, with security groups ``sg-10`` and ``sg-11``.  Chalice should
  also automatically configure the IAM policy with permissions to modify
  EC2 network interfaces.
* The ``foo`` function should have two connected layers as ``layer-arn-1`` and
  ``layer-arn-2``. Chalice should automatically configure the IAM policy.
* The ``bar`` function should use a pre-existing IAM role that was created
  outside of chalice.  Chalice should not perform an IAM role management for
  the ``bar`` function.
* The ``bar`` function should have an environment variable ``TABLE_NAME`` with
  value ``mytable``.

We can accomplish all this with this config file::

  {
    "stages": {
      "dev": {
        "environment_variables": {
          "OWNER": "dev-team"
        }
        "api_gateway_stage": "api",
        "lambda_functions": {
          "foo": {
            "subnet_ids": ["sn-1", "sn-2"],
            "security_group_ids": ["sg-10", "sg-11"],
            "layers": ["layer-arn-1", "layer-arn-2"],
          },
          "bar": {
            "manage_iam_role": false,
            "iam_role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::my-role-name",
            "environment_variables": {"TABLE_NAME": "mytable"}
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "version": "2.0",
    "app_name": "demo"
  }
