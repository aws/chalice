Chalice
=======

.. class:: Chalice(app_name)

   This class represents a chalice application.  It provides:

   * The ability to register routes using the :meth:`route` method.
   * Within a view function, the ability to introspect the current
     request using the ``current_request`` attribute which is an instance
     of the :class:`Request` class.

   .. attribute:: current_request

      An object of type :class:`Request`.  This value is only set when
      a view function is being called.  This attribute can be used to
      introspect the current HTTP request.

   .. attribute:: debug

      A boolean value that enables debugging.  By default, this value is
      ``False``.  If debugging is true, then internal errors are returned back
      to the client.  Additionally, debug log messages generated by the
      framework will show up in the cloudwatch logs.  Example usage:

      .. code-block:: python

         from chalice import Chalice

         app = Chalice(app_name="appname")
         app.debug = True

   .. method:: route(path, \*\*options)

      Register a view function for a particular URI path.  This method
      is intended to be used as a decorator for a view function.  For example:

      .. code-block:: python

         from chalice import Chalice

         app = Chalice(app_name="appname")

         @app.route('/resource/{value}', methods=['PUT'])
         def viewfunction(value):
             pass


      :param str path: The path to associate with the view function.  The
        ``path`` should only contain ``[a-zA-Z0-9._-]`` chars and curly
        braces for parts of the URL you would like to capture.  The path
        should not end in a trailing slash, otherwise a validation error
        will be raised during deployment.

      :param list methods: Optional parameter that indicates which HTTP methods
        this view function should accept.  By default, only ``GET`` requests
        are supported.  If you only wanted to support ``POST`` requests, you
        would specify ``methods=['POST']``.  If you support multiple HTTP
        methods in a single view function (``methods=['GET', 'POST']``), you
        can check the :attr:`app.current_request.method <Request.method>`
        attribute to see which HTTP method was used when making the request.

      :param str name: Optional parameter to specify the name of the view
        function.  You generally do not need to set this value.  The name
        of the view function is used as the default value for the view name.

      :param Authorizer authorizer: Specify an authorizer to use for this
        view.  Can be an instance of :class:`CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer`,
        :class:`CustomAuthorizer` or :class:`IamAuthorizer`.

      :param str content_types: A list of content types to accept for
        this view.  By default ``application/json`` is accepted.  If
        this value is specified, then chalice will reject any incoming request
        that does not match the provided list of content types with a
        415 Unsupported Media Type response.

      :param boolean api_key_required: Optional parameter to specify whether
        the method required a valid API key.

      :param cors: Specify if CORS is supported for this view.  This can either
        by a boolean value or an instance of :class:`CORSConfig`.  Setting this
        value is set to ``True`` gives similar behavior to enabling CORS in the
        AWS Console.  This includes injecting the
        ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` header to have a value of ``*`` as well
        as adding an ``OPTIONS`` method to support preflighting requests.  If
        you would like more control over how CORS is configured, you can
        provide an instance of :class:`CORSConfig`.


Request
=======

.. class:: Request

  A class that represents the current request.  This is mapped to
  the ``app.current_request`` object.

  .. code-block:: python

      @app.route('/objects/{key}', methods=['GET', 'PUT'])
      def myobject(key):
          request = app.current_request
          if request.method == 'PUT':
              # handle PUT request
              pass
          elif request.method == 'GET':
              # handle GET request
              pass


  .. attribute:: query_params

     A dict of the query params for the request.

  .. attribute:: headers

     A dict of the request headers.

  .. attribute:: uri_params

     A dict of the captured URI params.

  .. attribute:: method

     The HTTP method as a string.

  .. attribute:: json_body

     The parsed JSON body (``json.loads(raw_body)``).  This value will only
     be non-None if the Content-Type header is ``application/json``, which
     is the default content type value in chalice.

  .. attribute:: raw_body

     The raw HTTP body as bytes.  This is useful if you need to
     calculate a checksum of the HTTP body.

  .. attribute:: context

     A dict of additional context information.

  .. attribute:: stage_vars

     A dict of configuration for the API Gateway stage.

  .. method:: to_dict()

     Convert the :class:`Request` object to a dictionary.  This is useful
     for debugging purposes.  This dictionary is guaranteed to be JSON
     serializable so you can return this value from a chalice view.


Response
========

.. class:: Response(body, headers=None, status_code=200)

  A class that represents the response for the view function.  You
  can optionally return an instance of this class from a view function if you
  want complete control over the returned HTTP response.

  .. code-block:: python

      from chalice import Chalice, Response

      app = Chalice(app_name='custom-response')


      @app.route('/')
      def index():
          return Response(body='hello world!',
                          status_code=200,
                          headers={'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})


  .. versionadded:: 0.6.0

  .. attribute:: body

     The HTTP response body to send back.  This value must be a string.

  .. attribute:: headers

     An optional dictionary of HTTP headers to send back.  This is a dictionary
     of header name to header value, e.g ``{'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}``

  .. attribute:: status_code

     The integer HTTP status code to send back in the HTTP response.


Authorization
=============

Each of these classes below can be provided using the ``authorizer`` argument
for an ``@app.route(authorizer=...)`` call:


.. code-block:: python

    authorizer = CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer(
        'MyPool', header='Authorization',
        provider_arns=['arn:aws:cognito:...:userpool/name'])

    @app.route('/user-pools', methods=['GET'], authorizer=authorizer)
    def authenticated():
        return {"secure": True}


.. class:: CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer(name, provider_arns, header='Authorization')

  .. versionadded:: 0.8.1

  .. attribute:: name

     The name of the authorizer.

  .. attribute:: provider_arns

     The Cognito User Pool arns to use.

  .. attribute:: header

     The header where the auth token will be specified.

.. class:: IamAuthorizer()

  .. versionadded:: 0.8.3

.. class:: CustomAuthorizer(name, authorizer_uri, ttl_seconds, header='Authorization')

  .. versionadded:: 0.8.1

  .. attribute:: name

     The name of the authorizer.

  .. attribute:: authorizer_uri

     The URI of the lambda function to use for the custom authorizer.  This
     usually has the form
     ``arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/2015-03-01/functions/{lambda_arn}/invocations``.

  .. attribute:: ttl_seconds

     The number of seconds to cache the returned policy from a custom
     authorizer.

  .. attribute:: header

     The header where the auth token will be specified.

CORS
====

.. class:: CORSConfig(allow_origin='*', allow_headers=None, expose_headers=None, max_age=None, allow_credentials=None)

  CORS configuration to attach to a route.

  .. code-block:: python

      from chalice import CORSConfig
      cors_config = CORSConfig(
          allow_origin='https://foo.example.com',
          allow_headers=['X-Special-Header'],
          max_age=600,
          expose_headers=['X-Special-Header'],
          allow_credentials=True
      )

      @app.route('/custom_cors', methods=['GET'], cors=cors_config)
      def supports_custom_cors():
          return {'cors': True}

  .. versionadded:: 0.8.1

  .. attribute:: allow_origin

     The value of the ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` to send in the response.
     Keep in mind that even though the ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` header
     can be set to a string that is a space separated list of origins, this
     behavior does not work on all clients that implement CORS. You should only
     supply a single origin to the ``CORSConfig`` object. If you need to supply
     multiple origins you will need to define a custom handler for it that
     accepts ``OPTIONS`` requests and matches the ``Origin`` header against a
     whitelist of origins.  If the match is succssful then return just their
     ``Origin`` back to them in the ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` header.

  .. attribute:: allow_headers

     The list of additional allowed headers.  This list is added to list of
     built in allowed headers: ``Content-Type``, ``X-Amz-Date``,
     ``Authorization``, ``X-Api-Key``, ``X-Amz-Security-Token``.

  .. attribute:: expose_headers

     A list of values to return for the ``Access-Control-Expose-Headers``:

  .. attribute:: max_age

     The value for the ``Access-Control-Max-Age``

  .. attribute:: allow_credentials

     A boolean value that sets the value of
     ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials``.
